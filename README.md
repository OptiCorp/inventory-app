## Proper Code Etiquette Guidelines

### Files and Folders

-   Apply camelCase for folder names, such as `userProfilePage`, with the exception of component folder names that should be capitalized, i.e `UserProfile`.
-   Choose descriptive names for component files. For instance, use `UserProfile.tsx` instead of generic names like `Component1.tsx` or `Index.tsx`.
-   Organize folder structure hierarchically, considering trees and pages. Fro example, use `src/pages/add-item/.../batch`, where the batch directory is a subdirectory of its parent, and so forth.
-   Ensure page folders align with their corresponding URL segments. For example, name the page folder as `add-item-form` in `src/pages/add-item/add-item-form`, resulting in the URL `https://.../add-item/add-item-form`.

### Issues

Issues should have the following format:

1. **Type**: Use one of the following prefixes to specify the nature of the change:
    - **feat** for new features or enhancements.
    - **fix** for bug fixes.
    - **chore** for routine tasks or maintenance.
    - **refactor** for code restructuring.
2. **Descriptive Text**: Add a concise descriptive text.

If applicable, also give the issue a label.

**Example**

```
fix: Failed to Login BrowserAuthError
